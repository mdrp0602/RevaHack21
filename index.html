                The Prime Hostel Cancer Center is designated by the National Cancer Institute as a comprehensive cancer
                center. This means the clinic's renowned physicians, researchers and scientists carry out team-based,
                patient-centered research to develop the latest technologies and treatments to address unmet patient
                needs. As a result, people who come to the clinic for cancer care have access to hundreds of clinical
                trials in all phases.

                Mayo Clinic researchers share what they learn with other members of the National Comprehensive Cancer
                Network, a not-for-profit alliance of leading cancer centers dedicated to improving the quality,
                effectiveness and efficiency of care for cancer patients.
